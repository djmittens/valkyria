0a. Run `git branch --show-current` to identify the current branch.
0b. Study `ralph/specs/*` to learn the project specifications.
0c. Study @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0d. Study the source code to understand the current implementation.

## Branch Awareness

IMPORTANT: Check the **Branch:** field in @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
- If it doesn't match current branch, note this - the plan may be from different work.
- Update the **Branch:** and **Last updated:** fields when you modify the plan.

## Task

Analyze specs vs existing code and create/update @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
1. Use subagents to study specs and source code
2. Compare specs against implementation (gap analysis)
3. Create prioritized task list in @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
4. DO NOT implement anything - planning only

## Output

Update @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with:
- **Branch:** `<current branch>` at the top
- **Last updated:** timestamp
- Prioritized bullet list of tasks
- Each task should be small enough for one iteration
- Mark completed items with [x]
